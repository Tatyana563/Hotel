Plan:
Required to be done:
1) mapstruct, return hotelDTO
2) flyway

Questions:
1) projections with interface
2) return hotels with rooms
3) Optimise jpa model, remove redundant ids (Room-hotelId)

Future plans:
Dynamic query?

TODO:
1) @Mapper(componentModel = "spring", uses=RoomMapper.class)
public interface HotelMapper

    @Mapping(target = "cityName", source = "city.name")
    HotelBriefInfo hotelToHotelBriefInfo(Hotel hotel);


Create separate RoomMapper, CityMapper: rename cityName to city to avoid @Mapping

2) RestController ExceptionHandler, Custom Exc , HotelNotFoundExc extends ResourceNotFoundExc. (in browser how it looks like)


3) Data validation start date < end date; booking?

see https://blog.tericcabrel.com/write-custom-validator-for-body-request-in-spring-boot/
TODO:
4) ExceptionHandler for HotelId (not found in DB, ConstraintViolationException) - ok;
notes:
errors in body request  - >400 (some fields are absent, not valid)
not-existent ids as PathVariables - >404
5) roomcontroller, room_availabiliy check that absent in the table, update table;
6) throw RoomNotFoundException if case room doesn't exist in DB
ExceptionHandler ->404 - BEHAVIOUR is different from HotelNotFoundException
7) room_availability - > booked_rooms (rename+liquibase,flyway)

QUESTIONS:
in bookingResponce add name of the Hotel; Text: You have already booked the room in the hotel from...to....
Tried to use magic JPA hotelRepository.findHotelNameById(hotelId); - doesn't work
http://localhost:8080/rooms/1?checkIn=05_05_2023&checkOut=08_05_2023&=

TODO:
liquibase rollback - done;
add city to the first request - done;
remove ?starRating from the second request - done;
use Builder or chain accessor instead of constructor with parameters - partly done;
Enum change in liquibase - done;
all changesets in one file
in booking send email and do email notification after booking

Spring Security, authorisation for booking,
Endpoints to create hotel, room; (special role, Enum role)



1) JPA specification, Dynamic query. Paramaters  - list that changes; (parameters from hotel+room)
2) DB procedure (select ra from RoomAvailability ra where ra.roomId = r.id " +
                            "and ra.end>=:start and ra.start<=:end) ADD TO LIQUIBASE!!!!
3) Event Driven model
Use : Spring events instead of TransactionSynchronizationManager
EventHandler - send a mail;
4) (thymeleaf);
5) DB table  - username, login, password, email , roleId;
bicrypt hASH PASSWORD
DB table role;
6) Advice Controller - add ConversionFailedException:  for ConversionFailedException, say that meal=BREAKFAST2 is wrong, reason, what field is wrong
create hotel - admin; (correct name landlord) ok
book a room - user; (rentee?)
7) Specification filter filter by price  - http://localhost:8080/hotel/filter?distance=5&starRating=THREE&meal=BREAKFAST&price=40 dont show more expensive rooms;
Two 2 types of search -
1) list of hotels with rooms;
2) list of rooms with hotels;(Specification for the Room: RoomDtoWithHotel-> use HotelDtoWithoutRooms; or use HotelDto and roomList=null;)
8) Change GET for POST in registration!!!
9)  make login unique, not null
10) custom validation for login uniqueness
11)  //TODO: email notification confirm email
registration.

registration,

FUTURE:
DB locking/synchronisation while a few microservices work (lock on DB, table with locks)

**************************
why is it wrong?
http://localhost:8080/hotel/search?city=Barcelona&starRating=THREE&roomType=DOUBLE&checkIn=05_05_2023&checkOut=08_05_2023
but should be
http://localhost:8080/hotel/search?Barcelona&starRating=THREE&roomType=DOUBLE&checkIn=05_05_2023&checkOut=08_05_2023

TOGETHER OR SEPARATELY:
    @ExceptionHandler({HotelNotFoundException.class, RoomNotFoundException.class})
